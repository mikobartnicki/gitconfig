# Gitconfig

A set of Bash scripts for setting up my Git configuration. The scripts are
tailored to my personal preferences but they are simple enough to be easily
adapted to suit your own needs, so help yourself.

## Usage

Just run the scripts in any console supporting Bash commands. On Windows use Git
Bash, on Linux any terminal should work. To create global Git configuration
file, run:

    make_gitconfig

And to create global `.gitignore` file, run:

    make_gitignore

That's it, done!
